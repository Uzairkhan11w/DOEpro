# DOEpro 2.0.0

First public release.

* Analyses eleven designs: completely randomised, randomised complete block,
  Latin square, factorial CRD and RCBD (two to four factors), split-plot,
  strip-plot, and pooled (combined) analysis over environments for both a single
  treatment factor and factorial treatments.
* Chooses the correct error term for every comparison. A split plot reports its
  four distinct standard errors of a difference, the two mixed comparisons using
  a Satterthwaite-weighted *t*.
* Pooled analyses test each treatment effect against its own interaction with
  the environment, check the homogeneity of the error variances across
  environments (Bartlett), and break a significant environment by treatment
  interaction down environment by environment.
* Analyses several response variables at once, each with its own transformation.
* Screens the data against the assumptions and advises on a variance-stabilising
  transformation; nine transformations are available, with means reported back on
  the original scale.
* Grouping letters are shown only where the F-test is significant.
* Six post-hoc procedures: Fisher's protected LSD, Bonferroni, Tukey HSD,
  Duncan, Student-Newman-Keuls and Scheffe.
* Produces a downloadable HTML report carrying the DOEpro citation.
* Runs in the browser at <https://doepro.pages.dev> with no installation.
